RPCraft
=======

RPCraft is a roleplay plugin for the popular Minecraft server implementation Bukkit.

RPCraft is going to add player classes with different skills, buffs, and health/mana values, an adjustable K/D/A scoreboard,
a custom experience system, a custom pvp/team system, an API to allow users making their own class and skill, and many more cool features!

This plugin is still WIP, although the code in this repository will always compile without errors, you shouldn't expect it to do something.

RPCraft is open source, everybody may use this code in his/her own project if they give me credit.

Feel free to fork this repository and send pull requests if you think that you can implement some useful things.
